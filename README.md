○	Objective: Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads.
○	Solution: Based on the final model, it was found that the variables that mattered the most in the potential buyers are (In descending order): 1. The total time spend on the Website. 2. Total number of visits. 3. When the lead source was.
Keeping these in mind the X Education can flourish as they have a very high chance of getting almost all the potential buyers to change their mind and buy their courses.
○	Key Achievement: Submit the project using Python Jupyter Notebook using model Logistic Regression, Use RFE for Feature Selection, Building Model by removing the variable whose p- value is greater than 0.05 and VIF value is greater than 5, Predictions on test data set, Overall accuracy 81% Achieved a score of 96.67%
